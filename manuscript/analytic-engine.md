The Analytic Engine is the brain child of
[Charles Babbage][charles-babbage]. The machine is heavily inspired by
an other product of the industrial revolution: the
[Jacquard loom][jacquard-loom]. This loom could weave intriciate
patterns encoded into punchcards.

In this chapter we will study the plans of the Analytic engine.

The store is the area of the Analytic engine that can hold
numbers. Each number is represented by a rotor. Each rotor can store a
50 decimal number.

Note that the rotors have no notion of a decimal point. A rotor set to
`37` could represent any and more of the numbers `37`, `3.7`, `0.37`
etcetera.
