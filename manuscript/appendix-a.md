Obtaining Software
------------------

The workshop relies on [VirtualBox][virtualbox] and a
[virtual machine][vm]. In this appendix you will find details of
getting the virtual machine up and running.

### VirtualBox

VirtualBox is

> a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for
> enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely
> feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it
> is also the only professional solution that is freely available as
> Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public
> License (GPL) version 2.

It runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and Solaris. You can find an
appropriate installer for you platform at the
[VirtualBox download][virtualbox-download] page.

### Virtual Machine

Next step is obtaining the virtual machine created for this
workshop. It can be downloaded from [GitHub][ada-vm].

### Convenient Package

Instead of downloading the VirtualBox installer and the virtual
machine seperatly you can also download the [material][] in one fell
swoop. It includes installers for platforms Windows, OSX and Ubuntu
and the the virtual machine.

Using Software
--------------

To use the virtual machine proceed along with the following steps

1. Start VirtualBox
2. Import Appliance, via `File > Import Appliance`
3. Select the downloaded virtual machine
4. Start the virtual machine

This starts a virtual machine. The user on the machine is **ada** and
